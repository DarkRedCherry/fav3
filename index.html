    <p>Reading is an incredibly inexpensive hobby that provides so many benefits.

Most of the time, it requires little or no electricity to engage in reading, so you’re not burning up watts and adding to your energy bill. If you read outside or in a well-lit house, there’s no cost at all during daytime hours. At night, a tiny LED light eating less than a watt will provide adequate light for you to read by. 1,000 hours of usage of such a light costs about $0.15.

A single good-sized book will provide you with many hours of entertainment. Depending on the size of the book, a book will take me between two and twenty hours to read. A larger book, naturally, is at the higher end of that scale. It’s something that will involve me over a period of time.

Alternately, a single good-sized book will provide you with knowledge or enlightenment (and, sometimes, entertainment as well). A good book will make you think about some aspect of the world around you and make you reconsider that aspect a little, whether it’s human relationships, some aspect of the physical world, or an intriguing new idea. </p> </section>
